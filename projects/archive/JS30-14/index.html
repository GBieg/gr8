    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age,age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age,age2) // 200 100


  let name = 'wes'
  let name2 = name;
  console.log(name, name2);
  name = 'wesley';
  console.log(name, name2); // wesley wes


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.

  const team = players;
  console.log(players, team);
  team[3] = 'lux';
   // if you update an arr it will always reference back;




    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!


//HOW TO MAKE A COPY OF AN array:
const team2 = players.slice(); // it will return the whole array
const team3 = [].concat(players);
const team4 = [...players];

const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

  // const captain = person;
  // captain.number = 99; // DON"T DO IT LIKE THAT

  const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number : 99}); // BLANK + overwrite + 3rd arg

  // ONE LEVEL DEEP ! function CLONE DEEP
console.log(cap2);
    // and think we make a copy:
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
