Hello, I'm Grzegorz.
My goal is to become in the near future a Junior Front-End Developer. Here is how I try to achive it: 

- FreeCodeCamp;
- HakerRank;
- https://kursjs.pl/
- YouTube tuts like: Dev Ed, The Coding Train and others;
- projects (included on the GitHub);
- and creating my own Google Doc with the questions - answers which I faced during my study process in order to review them and make sure it will stick (flashcard way of study);

As well in the spare time I study:
- Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people by Aditya Bhargava;
- http://eloquentjavascript.net/; 
- French and Russian.
