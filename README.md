Hello, I'm Grzegorz.
My goal is to be a better version of myself and I want to do it by learning a new things. And as you can assume - one of the ways to do is through learning the fundaments of a front end developer. I want to achieve it by doing:

- FreeCodeCamp;
- HakerRank;
- https://kursjs.pl/
- YouTube tuts like: Dev Ed, The Coding Train and others;
- projects (included on the GitHub);
- and creating my own Google Doc with the questions - answers which I faced during my study process in order to review them and make sure it will stick (flashcard way of study);

As well in the spare time I study:
- Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people by Aditya Bhargava;
- http://eloquentjavascript.net/;
- improve English and French;
- learn Russian from scratch;
-

Upcoming goals/challenges:

- The Open Source Computer Science Degree;
